# 🚕 Ride Sharing Application — Backend

A backend-focused ride sharing system inspired by real-world platforms like Uber/Ola.
This project is designed to understand core backend architecture, role-based flows, and database modeling used in large-scale ride sharing systems.

The emphasis is on system design and extensibility, not on frontend UI or production-level completeness.


## 🧠 Purpose

Ride sharing platforms involve multiple actors and complex flows:

-> Riders requesting rides

-> Drivers accepting and completing rides

-> Managing availability, ride status, and data consistency

The goal of this project is to model these real-world workflows at a backend level, focusing on:

-> Clean data separation

-> REST API design

-> Scalable and extensible backend structure
